Notification API

As the ride sharing services are growing tremendously in number, it is becoming quite a difficult task to maintain the driver quality. To mitigate the problem, this project is aimed to improve the experience of drivers and passengers through implementing a feature. The feature will allow the users to know the completion rate of a driver considering last 100 rides that the driver took in last couple of days.
